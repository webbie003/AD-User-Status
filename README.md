# AD User Status
A simple PowerShell-based utility that imports a list of usernames from an Excel ```(.xlsx)``` file and performs LDAP queries to determine their status in Active Directory. This tool is helpful for user audits, licensing reclaiming, onboarding/offboarding reviews, and general access verification.

## 🧾 Introduction
I’m **not a developer** by any stretch of the imagination. I work in the **cyber security** field, and this tool started out as a simple **pet project**.

It came about after a colleague needed a way to periodically review the status of **Active Directory user accounts** pulled from a line-of-business platform. The goal? Reclaim licenses from disabled accounts.

I originally began writing a basic PowerShell script for the task... but then thought, *why not have some fun with it?* So I turned to **ChatGPT** to see how far I could take it — and this tool is the result.

I hadn’t really used any AI platforms before this, so this was a bit of an experiment — both to build something useful and to see what was possible with a bit of curiosity (and some help from an AI). It turned out to be a fun and surprisingly productive experience.

## 📋 Features
- Import users from Excel file (.xlsx)
- Query Active Directory using LDAP
- Categorize users as:
  + ![Example Import Format](images/Enabled_24px.png) Active Accounts – Account is enabled in AD
  + ![Example Import Format](images/Disabled_24px.png) Disabled Accounts – Account exists but is disabled
  + ![Example Import Format](images/NotFound_24px.png) Accounts Not Found – Not found in AD *(disabled account should be removed from AD after a period)*
  + ![Example Import Format](images/External_24px.png) External Accounts – Detected as an external UPN suffix
- Clear output display (console or exportable)
- Ideal for IT admins and audit teams

## ⚡ Quick Usage
This application is a standalone .exe, generated from a PowerShell script using [PS2EXE](https://github.com/MScholtes/PS2EXE). You're welcome to open PowerShell if you like, but there's no need to run any .ps1 files — just launch the .exe directly.
> For transparency and customization, the original PowerShell .ps1 [source code](./AD%20User%20Status.ps1) is included in the repository. Feel free to review, modify, or extend it to suit your environment.
1. **Prepare your Excel file**
   - Ensure it contains the three columns **Internal ID**, **Name** & **Email** in the order seen below.
   ![Example Import Format](images/Template%20Example%20Edited.png) \
   <sup>**Note:** If you don't have an **Internal ID**, just use any random number — they can all be the same. See Future Development Ideas; I have plans to mature this component.</sup>
   - Save the file with a .xlsx extension.
2. **Run the application**
   - **Option 1**: Double-click the .exe file, or run it via command line: ```ADUserChecker.exe``` 
   - **Option 2**: Alternatively, launch the Powershell .ps1 script using the regular PowerShell terminal or PowerShell ISE: ```.\Check-ADUsers.ps1```
      > 🛠️ Both methods work — use whichever fits your workflow. The .exe is great for convenience, while the .ps1 is available for transparency, debugging, or further customization.
4. **Follow the prompts**
   - Select browse and navigate to your .xlsx file.
   - Select **Check Users**, users will be processed and categorized under one of the following tabs:
     + ![Example Import Format](images/Enabled_24px.png) Active Accounts
     + ![Example Import Format](images/Disabled_24px.png) Disabled Accounts
     + ![Example Import Format](images/NotFound_24px.png) Accounts Not Found
     + ![Example Import Format](images/External_24px.png) External Accounts
> 💡 No PowerShell knowledge required — just run, import, review and export the results.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites
- PowerShell 5.1+ or PowerShell Core
- .NET Framework 4.6.2 or later
- .NET 6.0, .NET 7.0, .NET 8.0, .NET 9.0.
> 🔍 Note: I've intentionally choosen not to use the built-in Active Directory PowerShell cmdlets (like Get-ADUser) due to their relatively slow performance in large queries. Instead, it leverages direct LDAP queries for faster and more efficient user lookups. The script first attempts to connect using LDAPS (secure LDAP over SSL) however If LDAPS is unavailable, it will fail-back to standard LDAP.

## 🧠 Future Development
Here are some enhancement ideas I’m considering for future versions of the tool:
- Allow user selection of which columns to import and process from the provided .xlsx file.
- Improve the FAQ/help window for better clarity and usability
- Auto-generate a placeholder Internal ID if one is not provided
- Display summary statistics (e.g., number of active, disabled, external accounts)
- Auto-check for newer version or release tag on GitHub
